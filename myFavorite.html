		<h1> Why I like Giant Pandas better </h1>
		<p> I just think I can relate to the clumsiness of the Giant Panda. Also Giant Pandas are a world wide symbol or the World Wildlife Fund-Endangered Species Consevation. Also Red Pandas are known to disliking interacting with humans, but unfortunately both species of pandas are nocturnal.  </p>
